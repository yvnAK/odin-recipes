<h1>About Us</h1>
<section>
    Created by @axxk47. <br>
    Built as a part of the Odin Project Foundations course. <br>
    The intentions were to build a reasonably accessible and comfortable to use website without the use of CSS or
    JavaScript
    as they have not yet been introduced in the course.<br>
    Contact me through my email address at yushabh.work@outlook.com if any queries arise.
